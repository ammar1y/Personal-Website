# Analyzing YouTube Trending Videos in 2019

Around 1.5 years ago, a few months after entering the data-science field, I did an analysis of YouTube trending videos in US. That analysis was performed on trending videos of some months in 2017 and 2018; 40,000 videos were analyzed. The analysis attracted some interest on Kaggle and Reddit; I also received some emails praising the work done. That was 1.5 years age.

Today, I present an improved and expanded version of that analysis. This analysis is more advanced and contains new and interesting elements. Also, this time the analysis will cover more countries, not just the US.

## What are YouTube Trending Videos?

YouTube is the most popular and most used video platfrom in the world today. YouTube has [a list of **trending videos**](https://www.youtube.com/feed/trending). I'll quote the description of trending videos from [YouTube itself](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/7239739?hl=en):

> Trending helps viewers see whatâ€™s happening on YouTube and in the world. Trending aims to surface videos that a wide range of viewers would find interesting. Some trends are predictable, like a new song from a popular artist or a new movie trailer. Others are surprising, like a viral video. Trending isn't personalized and displays the same list of trending videos in each country to all users.
>
> The list of trending videos is updated roughly every 15 minutes. With each update, videos may move up, down, or stay in the same position in the list.

## Tools Used



 Here we will use **Python** with some packages like **Pandas** and **Matplotlib** to analyze a dataset that was collected over 205 days. For each of those days, the dataset contains data about the trending videos of that day. It contains data about **more than `40,000` trending videos**. We will analyze this data to get insights into YouTube trending videos, to see what is common between these videos. Those insights might also be used by people who want to increase popularity of their videos on YouTube.
